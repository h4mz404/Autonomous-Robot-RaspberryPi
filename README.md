## Overview

On February 6, 2018, SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon Heavy, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. In the spirit of interplanetary exploration, the ENPM 809T Grand Challenge for Spring 2023 involves simulating the construction of a shelter on Mars. Students will design and implement a ground robot capable of autonomously navigating the Martian landscape, collecting construction blocks, and transporting them to a predetermined construction zone. The project aligns with SpaceX's goal of sending cargo missions to Mars in preparation for human colonization.

## Project Requirements

### Learning Outcomes
- Apply kinematic models for robot design and control
- Utilize control system theory for robot control system implementation
- Integrate sensors and actuators into a mechatronic system
- Implement intelligent robotics algorithms, including image processing and motion control and planning

### Grand Challenge Tasks
1. **Navigation**: Traverse autonomously to locate and transport construction blocks using known landmark coordinates.
2. **Spatial Awareness**: Detect, differentiate, and interact with objects to avoid unwanted situations.
3. **Efficiency**: Complete the given task in the most efficient way possible.
4. **Strategy**: Employ effective strategies to optimize speed, task planning, etc.

### Rules & Specifications

#### Robot
- All students use the same base mobile platform kit, acquiring/installing additional components.
- Each student constructs their own robot with a safety shutdown switch.
- Wireless communication (preferably Wi-Fi) is required.

#### Testing Area
- Dimensions and characteristics specified for the testing area.
- Walls are black, obstacles are fixed, and the floor is flat and colored white/beige.

#### Building Blocks
- Basic cubic-shaped blocks with vertical gripping arms.
- Blocks can be Red, Green, or Blue.
- Cluttered Environment blocks can be White, Black, or Yellow.

#### Points
- Points awarded for delivering Red, Green, or Blue blocks to the construction zone.
- Points deducted for White, Black, or Yellow blocks delivered in part or in full.
